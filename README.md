# vimrc

Config file for my vim environment. I took it from [.vimrc](https://github.com/ezyang/vimrc/blob/master/.vimrc).

## bashrc

Contains bash commands that are loaded on every shell instance. For future reference, I'd wanna steal some from [.bashrc](https://gist.github.com/zachbrowne/8bc414c9f30192067831fafebd14255c).
